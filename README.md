## Logistic Equation Bifurcation Diagram Plotter

### Bifurcation Diagram
A program with GUI to plot the bifurcation diagram of the iterated logistic equation and explore it.

`The iterated logistic equation : X_(t+1) = r * X_t * (1-X_t)`

#### Features

- Plot any domain by specifying the x and y limits of the plot.
- Customize other variables such as n (number of iterates to skip), m (number of iterates to plot), the plot width and height.
- Use the rectangle zoom tool of the matplotlib toolbar to zoom into an area of interest.
- Each view generated is stored in history serially, and can be regenerated with ease.

All these help to view and study the features of the bifurcation diagram such as self similarity with ease.

### Examples

Contains a list of example programs that were used in the development of the code. Simple examples of tkinter and graph manipulation that have pedagogical value.

### matplotlibrc

This file contains custom matplotlibrc values used for plotting the graph.
